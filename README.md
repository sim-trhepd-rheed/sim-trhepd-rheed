# sim-trhepd-rheed

## Overview

The software 'sim-trhepd-rheed' is a simulator for total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction (TRHEPD) and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED).Please cite Ref. [1], if you use the software in a research paper. The software was written originally by Takashi Hanada and the present package on github is maintained by Takeo Hoshi. The software is based on the theory written in Ref.[2]. The present package contains Fortran codes in the src/ directory and Python3 scripts in the script/ directory. The present document is assumed to be built with gfortran in a standard Linux environment.

## Code preparation 

### Download the source code

Download the source code with git command in a working directory

$ git clone http://github.com/sim-trhepd-rheed/sim-trhepd-rheed

The following directory will be generated

sim-trhepd-rheed

### Build the binary files 

In the sim-trhepd-rheed directory, execute the command below in order.

$ cd src

$ make

Then the following binary files will be generated 

bulk.exe

surf.exe

xyz.exe

In an application study, one runs bulk.exe first for the calculation of the bulk part and
then, one runs surf.exe  for the calculation of the surface part. 
As an option, the data file of the atomic positions in the XYZ format can be generated by the binary xyz.exe.

Set the environmental variables properly so that you can run the binary files, if needed.

## Test calculation

Test calculations are presented in the sample/ directory.

## Mode swithcing between TRHEPD (positron) and RHEED (electron) modes

The default setting is the TRHEPD (positron) mode. 
If one would like to use the RHEED (electron) mode, one should modify the line 

ep=‘P'

into 

ep='E'

of the files src/surfm.f90 and src/bulkm.f90 before the compilation.
